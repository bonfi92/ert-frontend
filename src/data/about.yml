  E RT is a universe where clothes and accessories are crafted following the wishes of the original raw material.

  Many people inhabit this universe. They all see responsible design as a meaningful way to produce objects that last - an connections that last even longer.

  E RT employs responsible design and production, respecting the time and the needs of its creators: animals, natural resources, manufacturers, among others.

  The choice of using 100% natural fibres is a stance on durability and recyclability.
  Not all is certified. E RT selects suppliers and partners based on social and environmental commitment. More information on specific certifications is available in the detail section of each product.

  E RT takes a careful approach to its packaging: every element is designed to be as efficient as possible, with recycled paper, organic cotton and non-toxic inks as the main materials.

  E RT’s creations are designed to last, and three key processes are put in place to make their stories endless:

  - Repair
  Considering what we wear as organic elements, with their growth, their needs, and their scars. E RT commits to repai- ring all its creations upon request.

  - Resell
  Apparel can be a mirror of who we are and who we want to be. However, sometimes we don’t see ourselves in them anymore. E RT recommends and offers an evaluation of its creations to be resold independently or through E RT’s channels.
  ...
  - Recycle
  E RT strives to give a new chance to pure valuable materials through upcycling and material recycling. Thanks to the mono-material design, almost every piece is easy to recycle.
